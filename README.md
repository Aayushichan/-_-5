# Linear Regression for Predictive Modeling

I have successfully completed task 5 of the data science internship provided by Oasis Infobyte. This task involved using linear regression for predictive modeling.

## Project Overview

The project focused on developing a predictive model using linear regression. The goal was to analyze the relationship between the target variable and a set of predictor variables to make accurate predictions.

## Dataset

The project utilized a dataset containing relevant variables, including the target variable and a set of features. The dataset was preprocessed and prepared for modeling.

## Implementation

The project involved the following steps:

1. Data preprocessing: The dataset was loaded and preprocessed, including handling missing values, feature scaling, and data splitting into training and testing sets.

2. Feature selection: The most relevant features were selected based on analysis and domain knowledge.

3. Model training: Linear regression was applied to the training data to estimate the regression coefficients.

4. Model evaluation: The trained model was evaluated using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared to assess its performance.

5. Prediction: The model was used to predict the target variable for new data.


## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy

These dependencies can be installed using `pip` or `conda` package managers.

## Usage

To use the project code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from the GitHub repository link.

2. Install the required dependencies using `pip` or `conda`.

3. Run the Python scripts in the `code/` directory in the specified order, following the instructions provided within the scripts.

4. Evaluate the model performance using the evaluation metrics obtained.

5. Use the trained model for predicting the target variable for new data.

## Conclusion

Linear regression is a powerful technique for predictive modeling, and this project demonstrated its effectiveness in analyzing the relationship between variables and making predictions. The model's performance can be further improved by exploring feature engineering techniques, trying different regression algorithms, and optimizing hyperparameters.
